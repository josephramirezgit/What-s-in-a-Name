# What's in a Name?

C and C++ are block-structured programming languages that allow nested scopes and shadowing: an identifier declared in an inner scope hides any identifier of the same name declared in an outer scope. For every use of an identifier, a compiler has to determine which declaration it corresponds to. Every compiler has a name table, a component that keeps track of the identifiers in a program as well as information about them, such as their types. The project has an implementation of a name table (otherwise known as a symbol table) class.C and C++ are block-structured programming languages that allow nested scopes and shadowing: an identifier declared in an inner scope hides any identifier of the same name declared in an outer scope.
