# Whats-in-a-Name

 Every compiler has a name table, a component that keeps track of the identifiers in a program as well as information about them, such as their types. Your assignment is to write a good implementation of a name table class. To keep things simple for this project, the only information you need to keep track of for each identifier is the line number in which it is declared.
